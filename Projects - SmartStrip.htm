                        <small>May 21, 2014</small>
                    </h2>
                    <br><br><p align="justify">The idea for this Senior Design Project came about on a lazy summer day.
  After waking up at about 10 in the morning, I moved into the living room to continue loafing
  about. My goal was simple enough, find the television remote so I could tune into some 
  daytime ESPN programming. The only problem was the misplaced clicker which escaped my 
  search. At that point, I decided to forgo watching TV all together and made the transition 
  to my tablet’s internet connection.
<br><br></p>


<p align="justify">That’s when it hit me. I can’t even be bothered to turn on the television without
  a remote, so why should I be bothered to turn on my lamp, my computer, or my coffee maker without 
  one either.  Why hasn’t someone invented a way to control all of these electronics without having
  to physically get up? Is it even possible? Can I make this? I need a Senior Project after all…
  <br><br></p>



<p align="justify">With this idea in mind, I teamed up with my trusted EE 296 and EE 396 partner
  and we began to come up with the initial designs for this project. Many decisions such as form-factor,
  functionality, hardware, and software components still had to be sorted out.<br><br></p>

<p align="justify">So what are we even making?<br><br></p><p align="justify">After many meetings, the SmartStrip concept came into focus. Our goal was to
  make “smart” power strip which could control the On/Off status of its respective outlets. 
  Other features such as automatic timers, power limit settings, power consumption data, and 
  monetary visualizations were added in during brainstorming process. All of these features 
  would need to be displayed in some way to the users, thus, an Android application became necessary
  to the functionality of the project. <br><br></p>



                    
                    

<h3>Hardware<br>
                        
                    </h3>

<p align="justify"><br>The hardware components were the most tangible parts of the project. We needed 
  to find elements which could accomplish all of our objectives at a relatively low cost. First, we
  needed way to communicate between the power strip and the smart phone/tablet. 
  <br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Wifi? Xbee? Bluetooth? Which one of these protocol presented the best option? Well
  Wifi modules are relatively expensive and consume large amount of power while transmitting data.
  These modules would enable access to the internet at the cost of added design complexity. A web
  server which could store data and respond to client request would need to be implemented to establish
  communication between the two devices. These obstacles eliminated Wifi from our choices of
  communication protocol.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">What about Xbee? This method does allow point to point communication and is
  relatively inexpensive. No server setup is required and a variety of online resources are
  available for reference. But, your average tablet or smart phone does not communicate using
  Xbee protocol. An attachment/plug-in  hardware component would have to be physically connected
  to the device in order to establish communication. The lack of native hardware support made
  the Xbee undesirable.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">The only remaining option was Bluetooth. The cheap $8 modules made it an
  unbeatable value while its universally supported hardware made it accessible from any smart 
  phone or tablet. The availability of online resources along with its compatibility with the 
  Arduino microcontroller made it the most logical choice for our application.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Next, the ability to control the status of each outlet had to be addressed. The only
  viable option available to us were relays. Dealing with 120 Volts and potentially high currents
  eliminated the  smaller, low-power control circuits. Relays (controlled mechanical switches) gave 
  us the flexibility to fully control the On/Off status of each outlet.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Finally, we needed a way to measure the power consumption of each outlet. Luckily, 
  the fixed wall voltage of 120 Volts meant that we only needed current metering capabilities to 
  calculate the instantaneous power of the device. Again, large voltages (and potentially high currents) 
  eliminated the option for inline current metering circuits. This left the non-invasive option.
  Current sensing transformers (which output a proportional voltage) allowed us to measure the current
  flowing through each outlet without affecting the circuit's operation. <br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Additional components such as wires, terminals, amplifier boards, and inlet switches
  were used to complete the design. Most were only necessary for the prototype version of the product.
  <br><br></p><img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - SmartStrip_files/Components.jpg" alt="">

<br><h3>Software<br>
                        
                    </h3>
<p align="justify"><br>The Android development environment was the best option for developing our first
  application. This app in particular had to display large amounts of data while allowing the user
  to operate all of the features we aimed to create. 
  <br><br></p>

<p align="justify">
Eventually, a design/layout of the application's display was settled on. The main On/Off buttons were
  located up top with the power consumption data being displayed directly below. Power Limit settings
  were programmed and enabled users to turn the outlets off after the desired amount of power had been
  consumed (i.e. 1 KWh). The bottom portion of the app held the timer setting. This allowed the users
  to specify when the outlet would turn On/Off without having to actively change the status. 
  <br><br></p><p align="justify">
Finally, A Money Tracker Tab was introduced to better visualize the cost of each outlet. Live graphing
  features displayed the instantaneous power consumption while accumulated costs for each outlet
  were displayed below.
  <br><br></p>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - SmartStrip_files/AppDisplay.jpg" alt=""><br><h3>Fabrication<br>
                        
                    </h3>

<p align="justify"><br>After many hours of troubleshooting, the hardware was functional. It was 
  now possible to achieve Bluetooth communication between the two devices and control the status
  of each outlet.
  <br><br></p>



<p align="justify">Now, it was time to retrieve power consumption information from the CT 
  Transformers. Our group ran into an unforeseen obstacle after testing the output of the device.
  The CT Transformer was limited to an induced current of 30 Amps. This value was scaled and
  ran through a burden resistor which output a voltage value between 0 and 1 Volt. Unfortunately,
  the Arduino’s 10-bit ADC had an input range of 0 to 5 Volts meaning much of the ADC's resolution
  was not being utilized. The solution came in the form an amplifier board which took the input 
  of the CT transformer (35mm headphone jack) and applied a gain of 4 to the output. Two low-power
  quad-OpAmps were used to achieve this gain and improve the resolution of the device. The result
  was a more accurate reading of each outlet's instantaneous power consumption.<br><br></p>


<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - SmartStrip_files/AmpBoard.jpg" alt="">
<br><p align="justify"><br>
This left us with a working hardware device. Bluetooth communication, power consumption values,
On/Off control and power limit/timer features now operated correctly. It was now time to put everything
in a nice, clean enclosure. The original plan was to 3D-print a custom fitting case which would
complete the design, however, all of the on-campus 3D printers were out of commission during the
final weeks of the semester making a custom printed case impossible. 
  <br><br></p><p align="justify">Our only option was to construct an enclosure ourselves.
  <br><br></p><img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - SmartStrip_files/ClearCase.jpg" alt=""><br><p align="justify">This makeshift design left something to be desired. Future cases would
  allow for a smaller form-factor and more professional appearance.
  <br><br></p>
<p align="justify"> Maybe a coat of paint will help?
  <br><br></p>

<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - SmartStrip_files/Painted.jpg" alt="">

<br><p align="justify"> The bottom of the case was left transparent so the internal circuitry could be viewed.
  <br><br></p>

<br><h3>Results<br>
                        
                    </h3>


<p align="justify"><br>With the assembly completed, our final design accomplished all of the goals
  which were set at beginning of the project.

<p align="justify"><br>This demo quickly displays the On/Off capability of each outlet,  power
  consumption display, power limit settings, timer control, and cost visualization of the
  application.<br><br></p><p align="justify">Our group was able to fully complete the projects intended goals which
  utilized skills and knowledge obtained from the College of Engineering's curriculum. SmartStrip 
  was also featured in the 2014 PACE Business Plan Competition where the group advanced into the
  Semi-final round.<br><br></p>
