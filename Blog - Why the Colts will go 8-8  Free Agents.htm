                    <h2>Why the Colts will go 8-8: <br> Free Agency<br>
                        <small>June 5, 2014</small>
                    </h2>
                    <br><br><p align="justify">After the miraculous comeback against the Kansas City Chiefs, which involved overcoming
  a 28 point deficit, the Indianapolis Colts charged into Foxborough with intentions of reaching the Super
  Bowl. Facing a familiar foe in a Patriots team quarterbacked by Tom Brady, the Colts hoped to end their 
  streak of consecutive losses against the NFL’s most despised team. The tone of the game was quickly set
  after Andrew Luck threw an interception on his first set of downs and the Patriots never looked back. 
  New England completed the rout to the tune of a 44 – 23 beating, effectively ending the Colt’s post-season
  dreams and sending them into an early offseason.
<br><br></p><img class="gfyitem" data-id="ChiefAcidicHarlequinbug">

<br><br><p align="justify">With the new management heading into its third year of rebuilding, expectations
  are high for GM Ryan Grigson and Head Coach Chuck Pagano. The improvement from an embarrassing 2-14
  season to consecutive 11+ win campaigns, has led fans to place their team among the NFL’s elite.
  <br><br></p>

<p align="justify">Highlights, such as wins against the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks 
  (both played in the NFC Championship game), were taken in stride along with disappointing performances
  against the Miami Dolphins and St. Louis Rams. The season culminated during the week 7 showdown
  against Denver, marking the return of Manning to 'The House that Peyton Built'. Stellar performances
  from Andrew Luck and Robert Mathis led the Colts to victory over the previously undefeated Broncos 
  which left Indy with an impressive 11-5 record, including 4 wins against future playoff teams.
  <br><br></p>



                    
                    


<p align="justify">The ability to seem dominant against Conference Championship contenders while struggling
  against the lowly Oakland Raiders has labeled the Colts one of the biggest question marks in the upcoming 
  NFL season. The potential to boom or bust based on the knees of a 35 year old receiver leaves us with a 
  complex, albeit simply stated, question. 
  <br><br></p><p align="justify">How many games will the Colts win this year?
  <br><br></p>
<h3>Free Agency<br>
                        
                    </h3>
<p align="justify"><br>
  For 31, out of the 32 ,NFL franchises, the offseason is a time to reset, and assess the causes of an 
  unsuccessful season. Some teams lose talent due to cap causalities or retirement while others reload
  their roster through free agency and the draft. The goal, of course, is to better position your team
  to make a run at the Super Bowl.  Addressing areas of weakness while also retaining indispensable 
  talent is the hallmark of any successful front office. So, what exactly have the Colts done this 
  offseason to consider themselves serious contenders?<br><br></p>

<h3>Defense<br>
                        
                    </h3>

<p align="justify"><br>The resigning of 25 year old Vontae Davis ensures the Colt's best defensive back
  stays in Indy for an additional 4 years. The contract cost $39 million with $20 million guaranteed. 
  To put that in perspective, Richard Sherman (arguably the best corner in the NFL) signed a 5-year 
  $56 million contract with $40 million guaranteed this summer, while Darelle Revis signed a 1-year 
  $12 million contract with the Patriots.  Davis is nowhere near that caliber of player, yet, the market
  for 'shutdown' corners commands a premium for any contending team. Even though the contract value
  for Davis' talent isn't ideal, allowing Greg Toler to cover the likes of  Andre Johnson and Demaryius 
  Thomas would all but end the Colt's Super Bowl aspirations.<br><br></p>

<p align="justify">When healthy, Davis is an above average starter who can slow down any number one
  receiver, however, his tendency to gamble on big plays often leaves him susceptible to a long touchdown.
  Last season his single interception left him tied for 128th among eligible defensive players further 
  highlighting his inconsistency. The only hope for improvement lies in Davis' decision making abilities
  to avoid plays such as these.
  <br><br></p><img class="gfyitem" data-id="ClearcutWigglyGecko">




<p align="justify"><br>Staying on the defensive side of the ball, DE Arthur Jones and LILB D'Qwell
  Jackson were signed to the team at the beginning of free agency. Jones, who signed a 5-year $33 million
  contract, will play alongside DT Josh Chapman and DE Ricky Jean-Francois while displacing previous
  starter, Cory Redding. It is unclear what immediate impact Jones will have on the defensive line other
  than providing depth to league’s 26th ranked rush defense. This contract is the quintessential Ryan 
  Grigson signing, involving moderate amounts of money dedicated to a journeymen caliber free agent. 
  <br><br></p>
<p align="justify"> D'Qwell Jackson, meanwhile, cashed in on a 4-year $22 million contract, providing an
  upgrade over Pat Angerer and Kelvin Sheppard. Though, the linebacking corps was an area of need, Jackson
  appeared as the  third  best option in an assortment of free agent linebackers. Karlos Dansby and Daryl 
  Smith would have provided better run-stopping and coverage ability at a comparable contractual cost. It 
  is again unclear what kind of impact we can expect from a marginal upgrade at these positions, yet, the
  mere fact that these areas of weaknesses were addressed remains a silver-lining in the Colt's offseason.
  <br><br></p>
<img class="gfyitem" data-id="ConcreteImpartialBufeo"><p align="justify"><br>An area of weakness which was blatantly ignored resulted from the departure of veteran Pro-Bowler Antoine Bethea. The fee-saftey position in this year's free agency class was among the best in recent history. Options, such as former Buffalo Bills All-Pro,Jarius Byrd and Browns Second-Team All-Pro T.J . Ward were available for free agent signing. The lack of urgency now places undrafted free agent, Delano Howell, into the starting role with LaRon Landry complementing in the SS position.<br><br></p>
<h3>Offense<br>
                        
                    </h3>

<p align="justify"><br>The resigning of  RB Ahmad Bradshaw allows the Colts to continue their three-headed-back 
  approach. At a cost of $855,000, Bradshaw provides a low-risk, versatile option which will complement a Vick
  Ballard and Trent Richardson backfield. His ability to both run and pass block gives him an edge over the
  competition during key moments such as the red-zone and 3rd down. Though he spent most of last year sidelined
  with season-ending neck injury, he proved effective with his limited carries against the Dolphins and 49ers.
  <br><br></p>
<img class="gfyitem" data-id="AlertOblongHylaeosaurus">
<p align="justify"><br>The best, and potentially most impactful, signing this offseason was 26 year old WR 
  Hakeem Nicks. After the disappointing performance from one-year-Colt Darrius Heyward-Bey, Nicks will provide 
  a legitimate number-one receiving option on a team with limited wide receiver depth. At a cost of $3.97 
  million this year, the former Giant brings a low-risk, team friendly contract at a fraction of the number
  -one WR cost.
  <br><br></p><p align="justify">Nicks has already proven to be a successful primary target after teaming up with Eli Manning
  for the first 5 years of his career. His sophomore and junior campaigns consisted of consecutive 70+ catch 
  and 1000+ yard seasons. In the following years, Nicks was riddled with nagging lower-body injuries which
  limited his playing time and effectiveness on the field. If he remains healthy, his ability to separate
  from defensive backs with his deceptive speed, along with his ability to grab contested jump-balls will
  allow the Colt's to open up their offensive game plan. Seeing what Andrew Luck has done with the likes 
  of T.Y. Hilton and LaVon Brazil, it will be exciting to see what someone of Nicks' pedigree can achieve.
  <br><br></p>
<img class="gfyitem" data-id="PalatableLeanKittiwake">


<br><br><p align="justify">Other offseason moves include the resigning of punter Pat McAfee and kicker Adam Vinatieri. 
  Though Vinatieri is 41 years old, he still boasted a respectable 87.5% field goal percentage during the
  2013 season. It is unclear when the Super Bowl hero will retire, though his leg strength has recently come
  into question on field goals of over 50 yards.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Though punters and kickoff specialist are often marginalized in today's NFL, Pat McAfee
  remains the lone bright spot on the Colts special teams unit. McAfee is rated as the third most valuable 
  punter in football according to Pro Football Focus and ranks in the top 10 in kickoff touchback percentage. 
  His average yards per punt and punts inside the 20 make him a valuable special teams asset. In 2011 he 
  managed to lead the Colts in total special teams tackles which highlights the embarrassing state of the 
  kickoff/punt coverage unit.<br><br></p>

<img class="gfyitem" data-id="GeneralUnsungBluebird"><p align="justify"><br>It is impossible to accurately predict the impact of these free agent additions. 
  Promising stars in their prime are often exposed as products of a generous system while perennial 
  underachievers will occasionally stumble upon a perfect fit. We can only hope that GM Ryan Grigson has 
  an organized plan of attack which will allow these new starters to instantly contribute to the 2014 
  squad.<br><br></p>
