                    <h2>Why the Colts will go 8-8: <br>All About Luck<br>
                        <small>June 14, 2014</small>
                    </h2>
                    <br><br><p align="justify">Enough has been said about the shortcomings of the Indianapolis Colts roster. &nbsp;A lack of talent on the defensive side of the ball in addition to a questionable offensive line, leaves the team vulnerable to many forms of attack. Games against inferior teams are made difficult with the inability to protect the quarterback or the lead. However, as stated in the title, I project the Colts to finish the 2014 regular season with a record of 8-8. This requires some degree of competency as many NFL teams would view a .500 campaign as a success.<br></p><h3>Mathis<br>
                        
                    </h3><br><br>

<p align="justify">As the lone bright spot on an otherwise mediocre defensive squad, 33 year old Outside Linebacker Robert Mathis made a name for himself during the prime of the Manning era. Teaming up with former Colts DE Dwight Freeney, the two provided a formidable pass rush to complement a high scoring offensive attack. At the time, Mathis was considered a product of Freeney's dominance, which consistently commanded double teams from the opponent’s best linemen. Mathis was set free to rush against the traditionally less talented RTs and collapsed the pocket with a variety of pass rushing moves.<br><br></p><p align="justify">With the hiring of current head coach Chuck Pagano in 2012, Freeney and Mathis were transitioned from attacking 4-3 DEs to &nbsp;3-4 OLBs. This change in scheme negatively affected Freeney's ability to consistently get to the quarterback. His expiring contract coupled with his advancing age lessened the Colts interest in resigning him. In 2013, Freeney played snaps in a different uniform (San Diego Chargers) for the first time since he was drafted.<br><br></p><p align="justify">With Freeney gone, Mathis was pushed into the starting role as blitzing 3-4 OLB. Assuming a role similar to the Broncos' Von Miller and 49er Aldon Smith, Mathis surpassed expectations by having a career year.  He finished second in DPOY voting behind Carolina MLB Luke Kueckly after accumulating 19.5 sacks, 14 TFL, and 8 Forced Fumbles. All of which were career highs.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Mathis represented half of the total pass rushing production of the 2013 unit (42 sacks total) along with creating the more turnover opportunities than anyone else on the team. Offseason signings such as DE Art Jones and ILB D'Qwell Jackson can only help to improve the Colt's floundering pass rush and give Mathis more opportunities to sack the quarterback. Even though its unlikely the Mathis will be able to post similar statistics in consecutive career years, his continued on the field success is necessary for an above .500 season.<br><br></p>

<h3>Luck<br>
                        
                    </h3><br><br>
<p align="justify">Even his name lends itself to ESPN's headlining puns. In a surprising win, “Got Luck on our side” and after a disappointing performance, “Ran outta Luck”. Ever since his graduation from Stratford High school in 2008, Andrew Luck has been facing the absurd expectations set by analysts and scouts alike, yet, at every turn, the 6'4'' 230 lbs quarterback has always exceeded his seemingly limitless potential.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Coming out of high school, Luck was ranked the 4th best pro-style quarterback prospect in his class. Premiere programs such as Virginia, Northwestern, and Oklahoma State made runs a recruiting incoming freshman. However, coach Jim Harbaugh would prove to be the deciding factor in Luck's selection of Stanford as his chosen place of study.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">During his time at Stanford, Luck brought the traditionally modest program to new heights, equaling that status of perennial powers such as USC and Oregon. Playing three full seasons as the Stanford Cardinal's starting QB, Luck led the team to consecutive BSC bowl berths while smashing records of former Stanford legend, John Elway. These stellar performances, with an otherwise mediocre supporting cast, lead scouts to name Luck the most complete draft prospect since Peyton Manning. His status as the number one overall pick in the upcoming draft was all but certain.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Scouts were impressed  by Luck's prototypical size and athleticism which fit the mold of an ideal NFL QB. His surprising athleticism was only overshadowed by his command of the increasingly rare pro-style offense. Luck's ability to read defenses, make calls at the line, and deliver the ball accurately were all signs of a cant-miss prospect. Comparisons to Elway and Manning were consistent through the offseason as the Colt's positioned themselves into taking Luck with the first overall pick to replace their recently departed QB.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">After arriving in Indy, some speculated that Luck would crumble under the pressure to live up to Peyton Manning's legend. He quickly disproved those opinions by displaying impressive maturity for a rookie QB while leading the previously 2-14 Colts to a 11-5 record. His rookie campaign was made up a fair amount of spectacular plays and ill advised throws. Luck lead the league with 7 game winning drives in 2012 while leading all rookies in passing touchdowns and interceptions.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Colts fans knew they had hit the jackpot for the second time in a row, falling into two consecutive once in a generation QB prospects. Luck's fist professional pass was a 63 yard shuttle to Donald Brown, and ever since, he has been improving his game to become one of the league's most impressive young stars.<br><br></p><div class="gfyitem" style="display: inline-block;"><div style="width: 600px; position: relative; padding: 0px; z-index: 5; height: 338px;"><canvas class="gfyDotCanvas oTrans oShow" width="35" height="35" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; top: 5px; z-index: 30; opacity: 0.00499999999999918;"></canvas><canvas class="gfyPreLoadCanvas" width="600" height="338" style="position: absolute; z-index: 22; top: 0px; left: 0px; -webkit-filter: blur(2px);"></canvas><div class="gfyCtrlBox" id="ctrTidyWastefulCuscus" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; height: 40px; width: 102px; z-index: 10; margin: 0px; display: block; line-height: 0; opacity: 0.00499999999999918; background-color: rgb(0, 84, 165);"><img class="gfyCtrlPause" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/pause.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"><a><img class="gfyCtrlReverse" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/reverse3.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 6px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><a><img class="gfyCtrlSlower" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/slower.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 13px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><a><img class="gfyCtrlFaster" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/faster.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><div class="gfyCtrlTabPull" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; bottom: -21px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-style: none; width: 36px; height: 21px;"><img src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/pulltabsmaller.png"></div></div><video class="gfyVid" autoplay="" loop="" poster="true" width="600" height="338" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; border: 0px; padding: 0px; z-index: 25;"><source src="http://giant.gfycat.com/TidyWastefulCuscus.mp4" type="video/mp4" class="mp4source"><source src="http://fat.gfycat.com/TidyWastefulCuscus.webm" type="video/webm" class="webmsource"></video>

<p align="justify">One of the most underrated aspects of Luck's game is his ability to effectively run the ball. He is the only new-generation quarterback who isn't considered to be a dual threat. Players such as Robert Griffin III, Russel Wilson, Colin Kaepernick, and Cam Newton were all drafted within a year of Luck, yet, the Colt's QB leads the group in rushing TDs since coming into the league. He is not utilized in the same way that the read-option QBs are, but, his ability to scramble and keep drives alive is invaluable to the Colt's offensive game plan.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">One of the most underrated aspects of Luck's game is his ability to effectively run the ball. He is the only new-generation quarterback who isn't considered to be a dual threat.

He is not utilized in the same way that the read-option QBs are, but, his ability to scramble and keep drives alive is invaluable to the Colt's offensive game plan.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">During the 2013 season, Luck lead the league in “correct” decisions to scramble at a rate of 75%. A first down run of over 4 yards or a scramble which supplies a new set of down qualifies as a “correct decision” (These runs are tallied separately from designed running plays).  During this time, Luck assumed a pocket-passer role with only two designed runs. Meanwhile, players such as Robert Griffin III and Cam Newton had 42 and 59 respectively.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Athletically, Luck draws comparisons to Cam Newton who is of similar age. Both QBs are 6'4'' to 6'5'' and weigh between 230 and 240 lbs. During the combine, the Luck and Newton ran comparable 40 yard dash times at 4.67 and 4.56 second. This athleticism is deceiving to pass rushers who have had a difficult time catching up to Luck after his initial step into the pocket. His 6.0 YPC in 2013 reflect his excellent decision making under pressure to provide positive yards on a broken play.<br><br></p><div class="gfyitem" style="display: inline-block;"><div style="width: 600px; position: relative; padding: 0px; z-index: 5; height: 338px;"><canvas class="gfyDotCanvas oTrans oShow" width="35" height="35" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; top: 5px; z-index: 30; opacity: 0.00499999999999918;"></canvas><canvas class="gfyPreLoadCanvas" width="600" height="338" style="position: absolute; z-index: 22; top: 0px; left: 0px; -webkit-filter: blur(2px);"></canvas><div class="gfyCtrlBox" id="ctrScholarlyInformalGilamonster" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; height: 40px; width: 102px; z-index: 10; margin: 0px; display: block; line-height: 0; opacity: 0.00499999999999918; background-color: rgb(0, 84, 165);"><img class="gfyCtrlPause" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/pause.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"><a><img class="gfyCtrlReverse" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/reverse3.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 6px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><a><img class="gfyCtrlSlower" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/slower.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 13px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><a><img class="gfyCtrlFaster" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/faster.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><div class="gfyCtrlTabPull" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; bottom: -21px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-style: none; width: 36px; height: 21px;"><img src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/pulltabsmaller.png"></div></div><video class="gfyVid" autoplay="" loop="" poster="true" width="600" height="338" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; border: 0px; padding: 0px; z-index: 25;"><source src="http://fat.gfycat.com/ScholarlyInformalGilamonster.mp4" type="video/mp4" class="mp4source"><source src="http://fat.gfycat.com/ScholarlyInformalGilamonster.webm" type="video/webm" class="webmsource"></video></div></div><br><br>
<p align="justify">Regardless if their running ability, a quarterback is able to do the most damage via their throwing arm. Luck displayed all of the traits we traditionally look for in a young passer. Arm-strength, timing, and accuracy could regularly be seen on a game to game basis. His stats reflected both his undeniable talent and lack of experience, finishing with 23 passing TDs and 18 INTs. Luck's completion percentage of a mere 54.1% was the product of interim head coach Bruce Arian's vertical offense which had Luck consistently attempting low percentage throws for long gains. During his rookie year, Luck lead the league with passes traveling an average of 8.6 yards in the air. He also shattered Cam Newton's record of most passing yards from a rookie QB with 4374 yards.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">In his sophomore year, Luck cut down on the interceptions while attempting fewer passes. This change was due to new offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton's run-first approach. Aided by the acquisition of Trent Richardson, the Colts would often run the ball behind a mediocre offensive line. The inconsistent rushing attack would allow their opponents to build a lead well into the fourth quarter until Luck was able to run a up-tempo no-huddle offense.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">This is where the young quarterback tends to shine. While trailing in the 4th.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">With only 35 career starts under his belt, Luck has executed 11 game-winning drives. This accounts for nearly 50% of the Colt's total wins during this time (23 total). It seems when Luck is finally given the ability to run a no-huddle passing attack, the Colt's offense becomes one of the best in the league. While trailing in the 4th quarter, Luck has the 3rd best QBR of any quarterback, behind only Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers, further proving his clutch ability.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Though his overall statistics from 2013 weren’t spectacular (23 TDs 9 INTs), his competition percentage jumped nearly 10% and his interceptions were cut in half. Its as though Luck's potential is being limited by an offense more suitable for the 49ers and Seahawks. A once in a generation passer should not be handcuffed by conservative play calling while also being expected to bring his team back from a large deficit time and again. Whether its a walk-off TD against the Lions or a 28 point comeback against the Chiefs, Luck has shown the ability to carry an otherwise untalented team to the playoffs.&nbsp;<br><br></p><div class="gfyitem" style="display: inline-block;"><div style="width: 600px; position: relative; padding: 0px; z-index: 5; height: 338px;"><canvas class="gfyDotCanvas oTrans oShow" width="35" height="35" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; top: 5px; z-index: 30; opacity: 0.00499999999999918;"></canvas><canvas class="gfyPreLoadCanvas" width="600" height="338" style="position: absolute; z-index: 22; top: 0px; left: 0px; -webkit-filter: blur(2px);"></canvas><div class="gfyCtrlBox" id="ctrEarlySpiritedCoqui" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; height: 40px; width: 102px; z-index: 10; margin: 0px; display: block; line-height: 0; opacity: 0.00499999999999918; background-color: rgb(0, 84, 165);"><img class="gfyCtrlPause" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/pause.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"><a><img class="gfyCtrlReverse" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/reverse3.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 6px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><a><img class="gfyCtrlSlower" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/slower.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 13px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><a><img class="gfyCtrlFaster" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/faster.png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><div class="gfyCtrlTabPull" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; bottom: -21px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-style: none; width: 36px; height: 21px;"><img src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/pulltabsmaller.png"></div></div><video class="gfyVid" autoplay="" loop="" poster="true" width="600" height="338" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; border: 0px; padding: 0px; z-index: 25;"><source src="http://giant.gfycat.com/EarlySpiritedCoqui.mp4" type="video/mp4" class="mp4source"><source src="http://fat.gfycat.com/EarlySpiritedCoqui.webm" type="video/webm" class="webmsource"></video></div></div><br><br>

<p align="justify">Currently, expectations for Luck's 3rd year are through the roof. Many are expecting the Colts to run away with the division early while others are placing the team in the AFC Championship Game. However, the offense will need to continue progressing in order to make up for a lackluster defense. The return of Reggie Wayne and Dwayne Allen can only improve the passing attack while Pep Hamilton has made promises to open up the offense of Luck. It remains to be seen if there is enough talent around the young QB to make a Superbowl run this year, though,  it is important to remember that anything can happen When Luck is on our side.<br><br></p><div class="gfyitem" style="display: inline-block;"><div style="width: 600px; position: relative; padding: 0px; z-index: 5; height: 338px;"><canvas class="gfyDotCanvas oTrans oShow" width="35" height="35" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; top: 5px; z-index: 30; opacity: 0;"></canvas><canvas class="gfyPreLoadCanvas" width="600" height="338" style="position: absolute; z-index: 22; top: 0px; left: 0px; -webkit-filter: blur(2px);"></canvas><div class="gfyCtrlBox" id="ctrDecisiveWebbedKronosaurus" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; height: 40px; width: 102px; z-index: 10; margin: 0px; display: block; line-height: 0; opacity: 0; background-color: rgb(0, 84, 165);"><img class="gfyCtrlPause" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/pause(1).png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"><a><img class="gfyCtrlReverse" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/reverse3(1).png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 6px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><a><img class="gfyCtrlSlower" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/slower(1).png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 13px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><a><img class="gfyCtrlFaster" src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/faster(1).png" width="15" height="15" style="margin-left: 4px; margin-top: 12px; border-style: none;"></a><div class="gfyCtrlTabPull" style="position: absolute; right: 0px; bottom: -21px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-style: none; width: 36px; height: 21px;"><img src="file:///C:/Users/Jake/Website/Blog%20-%20Why%20the%20Colts%20will%20go%208-8%20%20All%20About%20Luck_files/pulltabsmaller(1).png"></div></div><video class="gfyVid" autoplay="" loop="" poster="true" width="600" height="338" style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; border: 0px; padding: 0px; z-index: 25;"><source src="http://giant.gfycat.com/DecisiveWebbedKronosaurus.mp4" type="video/mp4" class="mp4source"><source src="http://fat.gfycat.com/DecisiveWebbedKronosaurus.webm" type="video/webm" class="webmsource"></video></div></div>
