                    <p align="justify">How much is too much? It's a common question we ask ourselves, 
  especially in the college environment. When it comes to alcohol, we tend to
  disregard the voice of reason in our heads in favor of creating a memorable
  (sometimes impossible-to-remember) experience. You'd think that a bunch of 18-22
  year-olds would be the worst offenders, and you would be correct. But, second 
place should be awarded to the middle-aged working man. The corporate 
representative who's been forced to attend a college banquet because the 
higher-ups can't be bothered to go. The only redeeming quality of this Tuesday 
night held hostage is the promise of a little entertainment (via student
organization booths), a free meal, and of course, and open bar.
<br><br></p>

<p align="justify">This is where the idea of the Arduino Breathalyzer project 
  originated. The 2013 Holmescoming Banquet.<br><br></p>



<p align="justify">Every student organization was expected to host a booth which 
  displayed the skills and knowledge acquired from the College of Engineering's
  curriculum. The “best” booth would be awarded an extra $400 to spend at their
  discretion. Being a member of the IEEE student branch, it was my job to create
  a project which utilized the skills we have gained through EE while also
  providing entertainment for our generous guests.<br><br></p><p align="justify">Knowing that an open bar was the main draw of the event, 
  settling on a visual breathalyzer display came about naturally and, with 
  the help of some other IEEE members, we were able to create a winning 
  project.<br><br></p>



                    
                    

<h3>Design<br>
                        
                    </h3>

<p align="justify"><br>After designing a rough concept for this project, it was
  important to find hardware which was capable of meeting all of our requirements.
  We wanted to measure the alcohol levels of the guests and display it in
  visually pleasing fashion. Christmas lights were chosen as our medium
  (since flashing lights scream EE). Now, finding a sensor that could detect 
  the user's alcohol levels became a priority. Luckily, a breakout board for 
  a similar project was available online which utilized an affordable MQ-3
  Alcohol Gas Sensor. The DrinkShield Board was only compatible with an Arduino
  Uno which effectively ended our search for a microcontroller.
  <br><br></p><img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - Arduino Breathalyzer_files/DrinkShield.jpg" alt="">

<p align="justify"><br>Now that we could sense alcohol levels, we needed to
  consider our options regarding the array of Christmas lights. The Arduino's
  output pins are limited to 5 Volts DC at 40 milliAmps. This is nowhere near
  the 120Volts AC the Christmas lights ran off of. We would require “wall outlet” 
  levels of power to operate the array of lights.
  <br><br></p><p align="justify"><br>
To control the switching of these lights, power to the outlets would need to be
  variable. Two states of On and Off would suffice. These specifications led us
  to select relays as our source of power control. The mechanical relay switches
  we selected were compatible with a variety of microcontrollers. It operated on
  digital logic of 5 Volts, matching the Arduino's output range while requiring
  only 5 Volts of power to activate the internal switches. This compatibility 
  between the two systems made it easy to integrate into the working project.
  <br><br></p>
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - Arduino Breathalyzer_files/Relays.jpg" alt="">
<p align="justify"><br>Next, a wiring scheme had to be designed to make distribute power 
  across the 8-channel relays. A LOW input signal would activate the internal mechanical 
  switch, completing the circuit and allowing power to flow to the outlet receptacle.
  <br><br></p>

<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - Arduino Breathalyzer_files/CircuitSchematic.jpg" alt="">
<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - Arduino Breathalyzer_files/Wiring.jpg" alt="">
<p align="justify"><br>Everything was assembled and the connections were double checked. 
  The “hot” line was connected to the red wires which were in series with the relays. The
  green wires exiting the relays were connected to the outlet receptacles. The power would
  then flow through the plugged-in Christmas lights and the circuit would complete through
  ground (black).  The relays, at any time, could be switched On or Off from the microcontroller. 
  This state would then be mirrored by the string of lights, giving us the power to make 
  them flash/flicker on command.<br><br></p><p align="justify"><br>Now, All that was left was a quick coat of paint and the
  addition of the IEEE logo. <br><br></p>


<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - Arduino Breathalyzer_files/Breathalyzerfull.jpg" alt="">
<p align="justify"><br>
The availible software libraries were open-source and came from the DrinkShield website
  (linked below) which took care of the ADC conversion from the MQ-3 sensor. Some changes
  were made to the Arduino's outputs which varied the On/Off state of the relays proportional
  to alcohol levels. This created a flashing array of Christmas lights which entertained
  our guests and landed us in first place among the other booths.
  <br><br></p>

<h3>Results<br>
                        
                    </h3>


<p align="justify"><br><br>In this video, the Christmas lights are strung up in the background 
  around a pair of palm trees. A demo is performed by blowing an equivalent of pure Tequila 
  directly onto the MQ-3 sensor. This registered a maximum score which activated all 8 strings
  of lights.

<p align="justify"><br>I would recommend this project for anyone comfortable with developing on an
  Arduino. Wiring all of the outlet receptacles turned out to be the most challenging aspect 
  if the project. <br><br></p>
