                    </h2>
                    <p align="justify">Technology has been advancing at a steady and unyielding pace. What was once
  considered groundbreaking and revolutionary a few months ago will be considered mundane in the
  blink of an eye. The architecture, fabrication methods, and even materials which makeup the
  newest gadgets have been constantly evolving over time. The recorded shrinkage of the transistor 
  (the foundation of modern-day electronics) has allowed our devices to become faster and more
  powerful, while also assuming a smaller form factor. Currently, silicon is the prevailing 
  material from which we create these semiconductors, yet, we are fast approaching the physical
  limitations that this material can offer.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



<p align="justify">To keep advancing technology at its current pace, a new material must seize silicon's 
  semiconductor crown. The new wonder material in question hails from a more modest background. 
  Pencil-lead. But, not just any type of lead (which is actually graphite) will do. A two-dimensional 
  plane of carbon-graphite promises to aid all of these technological woes. <br><br></p>

<br><br>

<p align="justify">This nex-gen material was discovered by a research group at Manchester University 
in 2004. The first two-dimensional planes were created by placing small pieces of pencil graphite onto 
a roll of household Scotch Tape. The tape was pulled apart repeatedly until only a two-dimensional layer 
remained. Andre Giem and Konstantin Novselov were then awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for their 
contributions to this research.<br><br></p><p align="justify">But what makes two-dimensional graphite (also know as graphene)  so special? Well, 
  its peculiar shape gives it attractive electrical properties. The planar material has a zero bandgap
  and high electron mobility making it the perfect candidate for electrical conduction. Research
  utilizing graphene as a material for super-capacitors would allow batteries to charge in a matter of 
  seconds. Physical applications using graphene as a replacement for charcoal water filters has also
  received some attention. These promising characteristics make graphene out to be the perfect material.
  So what's the drawback? <br><br></p>



<p align="justify">It's expensive.<br><br></p><p align="justify">The best method of “mass producing” graphene required and expensive CVD 
  (chemical vapor deposition) machine. These pieces of equipment can cost hundreds of thousands
  of dollars which puts large quantities out of reach of many research group. The goal of my
  junior project was to explore more cost effective ways of synthesizing this wonder-material to make
  it more accessible for research and development.<br><br></p>



                    
                    

<h3>Design<br>
                        
                    </h3>



<p align="justify"><br> This was not a standard design and fabrication project like most x96 classes. 
  Rather, its focus centered  on research and experimental design. The inspiration for our synthesis
  technique came from a UCLA research group who first performed this particular method in 2012. Our goal 
  was to recreate the results of this experiment and attempt to improve its production yield.
  <br><br></p><p align="justify">Instead of chemically depositing layers of graphene through a CVD machine, the research
  group used a simple LightScribe disc drive. This drive was capable of etching images onto the top side
  of a blank CD using a lower power laser. After coating the top side of the CD with graphite-oxide, the
  laser “burned” the chemical into two-dimensional graphene.
  <br><br></p><img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - Graphene Synthesis_files/setup.jpg" alt="">

<p align="justify"><br>After ordering 50mg of graphite-oxide, we tested multiple types of plastic which
  would place on the CD. Plastic folder sheets, transparency papers, and thin packaging plastics were
  coated with the liquid graphite-oxide and set to cure overnight. 
  <br><br></p>

<p align="justify">
When the liquid had solidified into a layers of hardened graphite-oxide, we programmed the LightScribe
  software to completely overlap the surface of the CD to avoid any gaps in coverage.
  <br><br></p>

<br><h3>Results<br>
                        
                    </h3>


<br><br><p align="justify">
When the burn cycle had finished, we inspected the layer of graphite-oxide to see if there was any
  distinguishable differences. We noted visible marks were the laser had made its passes and say a
  darkening of the chemically affected area.
  <br><br></p>


<img class="img-responsive img-border img-full" src="./Projects - Graphene Synthesis_files/resultscombined.jpg" alt="">






<p align="justify"><br>When testing the conductive properties of the sample, we were unable to obtain an 
  ohmic reading from the digital multimeter. Though this method is known to produce relatively low 
  amounts of two-dimensional graphene, the proposed methods allows production on a very large scale.
  Improvements in equipment such as a higher definition LightScribe drive along with  a graphite-oxide
  solution of higher concentration would better our results.<br><br></p><p align="justify"><br>
We were unable to determine if the laser passes were close enough to physically link the line of 
  “burnt” graphite-oxide. This LightScribe drive was built-in to my current laptop which did not have 
  the same power output or resolution of new models.
  <br><br></p>
<p align="justify"><br>
Though we were unable to successfully recreate the UCLA experimental method, out group was able to
  research a new and developing material along with designing experimental methods to produce it.
