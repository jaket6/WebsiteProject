                    <h2>Why the Colts will go 8-8: <br>The Draft<br>
                        <small>June 7, 2014</small>
                    </h2>
                    <br><br>
<p align="justify">Heading into the the draft, it was widely believed that the Colts would focus on the
  defensive side of the ball. A lack of corner back depth which consisted of a single quality player, along
  with the non-existent starting FS made the secondary an obvious target for the leagues 20th ranked passing
  defense. Even with these shortcomings in mind, the front office refused to take a defensive player until 
  the 166th overall pick which involved and unpolished DE from Ball State.
<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">To start things off, lets introduce the Colt's first round pick in the 2014 NFL draft.
<br><br></p><img class="gfyitem" data-id="FragrantIncompleteDromaeosaur">
<br>

<p align="justify"><br>With a final record of 12-6, the team was slated to make the 26th overall selection.
  Prospects such as Washington State's Deone Bucannon and Northern Illinois' Jimmie Ward were availible first 
  round talents which would have addressed the team's secondary needs. However, two weeks into the 2013 season,
  a win-now attitude was adopted after Vick Ballard went down with a season-ending knee injury. The lack of 
  depth at RB led the Colts to deal their upcoming first round pick for second-year pro Trent Richardson.
<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">At the time, Richardson was considered a top prospect with an impressed 10+ touchdown 
  and 950+ yard rookie campaign. Some critics accused Cleveland of tanking the season and trading away assets 
  for future rebuilding efforts. As it turns out, the Browns pulled off the trade of the year as Richardson
  went on to average 2.9 YPC with a grand total of 3 touchdowns. His starting role was reduced mid-season 
  to a shared backfield with Donald Brown who provided a more consistent running and receiving threat. By
  the end of the season, Football-Outsiders' advanced metrics had Richardson ranked as the 45th most 
  effective running back across the 2013 season (keep in mind there are only 32 NFL starting RBs). 
<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Going forward, Richardson is expected to share the carries with recently resigned,
  Ahmad Bradshaw, and former first-round-pick Donald Brown.
<br><br></p><img class="gfyitem" data-id="MeatyFoolishDouglasfirbarkbeetle">
<br>

<p align="justify"><br>With their first official selection, the Colts chose OT Jack Mewhort 59th overall. Mewhort, a three year starter at Ohio State, had played various positions across the offensive line including left tackle and right/left guard. Measuring 6'6'' and a weight of 309 lbs, he possess prototypical size for an NFL caliber guard. Though, this selection does not address the glaring hole at center (which currently has 4th round pick Kahled Holmes starting) Mewhort will most likely be moved inside to replace journeymen Hugh Thorton.
<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Mewhort's combine numbers were average all around. His 40 yard dash, 3 cone drill, and 20 yard shuttle were middle of the pack for and offensive lineman. He promises NFL level strength with 28 repetitions of a 225 bench press and will only continue to grow stronger with an NFL training regiment. His lateral quickness and ability to explode off the snap could use some improvement to positively affect his play in the running game. These factors led him to a 2nd-3rd round grade entering the NFL draft.
<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">With the Colt's offensive line, by all accounts, being mediocre compared to other NFL teams, it seems prudent to invest in quality players to protect Andrew Luck. It is hard to argue against the logic of GM Ryan Grigson, who played as an offensive lineman at the college level and understands that winning begins in the trenches.
<br><br></p><img class="gfyitem" data-id="FittingKeyHarvestmouse">
<p align="justify"><br>The third, and possibly the most exciting pick in this year's draft, came in the form of Mississippi WR Donte Moncrief. This prospect entered the draft with impressive combine times and career statistics. Coming from an SEC school, which was particularly conservative with its passing game, Moncrief was able to post impressive numbers beginning with his first season as a red-shirt freshman. During his career, he accumulated 2,371 yards and 20 touchdowns while facing the best defenses college football had to offer.
<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">At the combine, he ran a blazing 4.40 second 40 yard dash along with impressive 3-cone and 30 yard shuttle times. He possess elite NFL speed which will provide a deep threat for third year QB Andrew Luck. With a height of 6'2'' and weight of 221 pounds, Moncrief possess prototypical receiver size and will be able to hold his own against larger, more physical corner backs. His one fault lies in his ability to run precision timing routes which is a common problem many rookie WRs face.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Moncrief's projected 1st-2nd round draft grade made him a steal with the 90th overall pick. It is understandable why GM Ryan Grigson would forgo strengthening the defensive side of the ball when a prospect of such value remained on the board. With this addition Moncrief, along with free agent acquisition of WR Hakeem Nicks, the Colt's look to have one of the deepest WR corps in the NFL.<br><br></p><img class="gfyitem" data-id="WebbedVeneratedAfricanclawedfrog">

<p align="justify"><br>Finally, in the 5th round of the 2014 NFL draft, the Colts selected their first
  defensive prospect. DE Johnathan Newsome was picked 166th overall from Ball State to help improve the
  Colt's non-existent pass rush (outside of Robert Mathis).  Newsome has become accustomed to playing
  on the right side of the defensive line where he accumulated the majority of his 18.5 career sacks.
<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Coming from a Hybrid 3-4 defensive scheme, Newsome will will be familiar with the coverage and blitzing packages used by defensive coordinator Greg Manusky. His quick first step allows him to explode off the ball and make use of his effective swim move. &nbsp;Though, a common concern held by scouts was his smaller than average size. &nbsp;Measuring at 6'3'' and 247 lbs, Newsome will have trouble holding his own in the running game against larger offensive linemen.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Other concerns which affected his pre-draft grade came in the form of multiple off the field incidents. At the beginning of the Spring '11 semster, Newsome failed to meet academic standards and was benched for spring practice. The following year, he was charged with possession of marijuana and held on warrant for alleged shoplifting. Though most 5th round picks are not expected to contribute to their team immediately, it is unclear whether Newsome will be able to stay on the field long enough to make an impact on the team.<br><br></p><img class="gfyitem" data-id="FaintCarelessIchthyostega">
<p align="justify"><br>The final two picks made in the 6th and 7th rounds were ILB Andrew Jackson and OT Ulrick John. It is not unusual for late round prospects to be cut before the start of the regular season. Most analysts project these players to make the Colts practice squad while remaining absent from the 53-man game roster.
<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Andrew Jackson played at Western Kentucky University, a medium sized FBS school playing in the Sun Belt conference. Jackson led his team in solo tackles for consecutive seasons while playing the 3-4 MLB position. His ability to make sure tackles in the open field made him and interesting prospect to the Colts. However, his off the field work ethic has come into question from trainers when his playing weight fluctuated throughout the season. Jackson did not participate in the scouting combine due to a medical injury and is not expected to win the starting job over incumbent MLB Jerrell Freeman.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">The final selection made by the Colts was Ulrick John with the 232nd overall pick (from the Ravens). John impressed during the Georgia St. Pro Day where he ran a speedy 5.02 second 40 yard dash while weighing 288 lbs. However, questions about his overall strength arose when he could only muster 20 repetitions of a 225lb bench press. Reviewing game film highlights his weaknesses against speed rushers and shorter players while his university only played lower level competition in an FBS conference.<br><br></p>
<img class="gfyitem" data-id="OrnateMilkyDaddylonglegs"><p align="justify"><br>Though the Colts upgraded certain positions with promising early round prospects, they failed to use any valuable picks on the defensive side of the ball. Corner back and safety remain weak spots on an already mediocre defense while pass rush remains a one man show. Additions to the front 7 should improve run defense compared to last year's unit and help to provide additional pressure outside of Robert Mathis.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">It seems that a team which tried to establish themselves as a &nbsp;power-run team is making a transition to the Colts of old. Concentrating free agents acquisitions and draft picks on the offensive side of the ball seem to indicate a trend of relying solely on Luck's offensive capabilities. Leaving the keys to the car in the hands of a franchise quarterback has proven to work in the past. Only time will tell if there is enough help around the young QB to make a legitimate Super Bowl run.<br><br></p>
