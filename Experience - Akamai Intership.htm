                        <small>June 9, 2014 - August 6, 2013</small>
                    </h2>

<p align="justify">During this six week internship program, i was assigned a project by my mentor to work on daily and was expected to perform a full academic presentation at the end of my stay. I was assigned to the Smithsonian Submillimeter Array in Hilo, Hawaii. My project was to design and construct a PID controller to adjust the cooling fan speed of any closed system. It was required to keep the system stable to within one degree celsius while exposed to the temperature conditions &nbsp;atop the Mauna Kea summit.<br><br></p>

<p align="justify">The project consisted of many steps which started with the research of control theory and the PID system. The PID system then had to be programmed onto a microcontroller and &nbsp;physically applied to a test enclosure with simulated heat sources and cooling fans. The tuning of the system took place with overnight simulations and the values of each coefficient were adjusted to reach an optimal value.<br><br></p><p align="justify">To make this system applicable to any enclosed system, Matlab simulation software was used determine the optimal value of each coefficient after collecting control data overnight. This reduced the amount of time necessary for the tuning process from weeks to days. The PID control system and software methods were later applied to working equipment on the summit of Mauna Kea.<br><br></p>

<p align="justify">During the internship, many skills/dutires were required to complete the project.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">
- Research of Control Theory, PID systems, Tuning methods, Cascaded PID systems <br>
- Programming of Microcontroller in C<br>
- Circuit schematic drawings of test enclosure <br>
- Soldering/Wiring of test enclosure<br>
- Application and knowledge of BJTs, switching applications, biasing, applied with microcontroller<br>
- Testing/Simulation practices, recording data using thermistors, setting up controlled environment, recording all procedures and results<br>
-  Matlab simulation software, importing logged data into a matrix, writing PID code, simulating using PID tools/tuner, finding optimal coefficients using collected control data<br>
- Microsoft Office, Excel, Word, Powerpoint<br>
- Technical Presentation, Powerpoint, presenting the project to other students in the Akamai program
  <br><br></p>
<p align="justify">Along with the technical knowledge that i gained through the internship i was introduced to the skills needed to succeed in the workplace environment such as promptness, full time work ethic, and meeting the six week deadline.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">The project was a success and the PID controller was able to regulate the internal temperature of the test enclosure to within one degree celsius under a range of operating conditions. The Matlab method i discovered was able to produce PID coefficients which met the strict specifications while only requiring one day of data collection. Now the expensive and delicate astronomical systems atop the summit of Mauna Kea had an adequate cooling system which could be applied to an enclosure of any size and shape without the worry of overheating and damaging the equipment</p><br><br>
